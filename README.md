## install

First you need to install node js. Use the following link to get the latest version.
<br>
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Use the following commands in you directory to setup the project.
<br>

Install node modules with 
<br>
`npm install` 
<br>
Install nodemon so you don't need to restart the server every time you does any changes 
<br>`npm install -g nodemon`

## Running 

Use the following command to start the server.
<br>
`nodemon`
<br>
By default the server will start on port **8080**. You can change that if you wants to.
<br>
Now open your browser and go to **http://localhost:8080**.
<br>
Login with github credentials to view the profile.
<br>
**Important**
If the nodemon dosen't start the server properly use `node index.js` to start the server
